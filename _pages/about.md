Hi! My name is Jingyuan Zhu, or in Chinese, “朱敬渊”. I recently graduated with a Master’s degree in Mathematics and Applications from Paris-Saclay University.

My master thesis was conducted under the supervision of [Gabriel Angelini-Knoll](https://www.gangeliniknoll.com/) and [Geoffroy Horel](https://geoffroy.horel.org/). Previously, I was an undergraduate student at Tsinghua University, and [Weiyan Chen](https://www.weiyanc.com/) was my thesis supervisor then.

My research interests include the following:

Higher category and higher algebra, and their parametrised/equivariant variants;
Algebraic K-theory and Hermitian K-theory for \infty-categories;
Stable homotopy theory;
Homotopical algebra.
Check here for a detailed statement.

CV is available upon request.
